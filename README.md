Summer 2017 - current time

# My Vocabulary

Program represents vocabulary for phone and has a maximally minimalistic design (it was created for own using). Allows:
* easily add new words
* specify part of speech and enter several translations for the same word
* group words by topic
* test yourself in both languages

The program is appended as the need arises for a new option; the next change is likely to be the possibility of testing for each group separately
